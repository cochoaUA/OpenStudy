\r\n\r\nDrummer , I understand. Many books have mistakes . Even in our textbooks , there
are some mistakes but usually , those are printing mistakes. I can suggest you some books
for design but it will be better if you search with some of the keywords here :\r\n\r
\nhttp://libgen.org \r\n\r\nThis site provides books (ebooks) for all topics. May be, you
get a book of your choice and matching your syllabus. \r\n\r\nElse, search on google for
design resources. There are many resources where you can these type of stuff.\r\n\r\nBest
of luck! ",

"from" : "sotres",
"body" : "Hi, I recommend you to see what kind of things you want
to do, there are different areas, modelling, texturing, rigging, animation, lighting and
rendering, depending of what area you want to develop choose a program. The most part of
studios are looking for specialised people.\r\n\r\nThere are different programs and each
one is good in one thing (or a lot of things), for example if you want to make some
characters or some really specialised things I recommend you to use Autodesk Maya, if you
instead want to do some motion graphics with 3D and some fast things that look really good
I recommend you Cinema 4D. If you want to do some Architecture stuff use 3D max or
Autocad.\r\n\r\nMaya is really good, I love to model and make characters with it , but to
use some textures Cinema 4D is really cool, you can download Gorilla grayscale textures
and make things look really cool so fast. Also Maya is really good to animate, but Cinema
4D also is good.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I recommend you is to buy a license of Digital
Tutors (http://www.digitaltutors.com) is $225 dollars 6 months and they have almost all
the programs for 3D, is a really good option to learn and see different things. Also you
could buy the personal license with a friend (but it's not really legal) and share it to
try it. Really this is not Digital Tutors publicity, it totally worth it,( I got it 2
months a go and I should have it a long time a go) when I started (almost 5 years ago) I
looked everything that was free, and I totally hated it, because when I find something
good almost all the times was incomplete, and is totally frustrating to be watching a
tutorial and have to cut it in the half because you don't have the next file. Now there
are things in youtube really useful. \r\n\r\nAlso learn to use After effects is really
useful to composite and to do some easy 3D stuff, look the plugin element 3D from Video
Copilot, is really useful to do some fast stuff, the render is so fast (really fast). \r\n
\r\nIf you have iphone (I dont know if is in android) I recommend you to download this
apps : FPS calculate (to take the time of your movements )and motion timer (to make some
animation curves of your movements) it is an initial kit to animate. Also read the
animator`s Survival Kit it is a really good book and gonna make you understand the 12
principles of animation.\r\n\r\nIf in the future you really like animation, look to buy a
Wacom, it's also really useful in animation for modelling, texturing and make some
sketches.\r\n\r\nYou will need a lot of patience with the renders, 3D animation is a
combination of technology, art and a lot of patience. Say good bye to your butt, you gonna
be seated a lot of time :P\r\n\r\nAlso is useful learn to draw, make your first moves with
some tutorials.\r\n\r\nHope it could be useful and good luck with animation :)\r\n\r\n \r

courses in College would you recommend taking? I read somewhere that I should of taken a
drawing class in High School. Is that true? Because I suck at Drawing, I can barely draw a
stick person. I know a lot about the design world too, like Web Design as well. Is there a
course I should take that would cover both graphic and web design? I also self-taught
myself on both subjects, I didn't take a class, read a book etc., So not sure if that
would make a difference. \n\nI hope this is okay question to ask in this section!\n
