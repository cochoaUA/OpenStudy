			"body" : "Hi, I recommend you to see what kind of things you want to do, there are different areas, modelling, texturing, rigging, animation, lighting and rendering, depending of what area you want to develop choose a program. The most part of studios are looking for specialised people.\r\n\r\nThere are different programs and each one is good in one thing (or a lot of things), for example if you want to make some characters or some really specialised things I recommend you to use Autodesk Maya, if you instead want to do some motion graphics with 3D and some fast things that look really good I recommend you Cinema 4D. If you want to do some Architecture stuff use 3D max or Autocad.\r\n\r\nMaya is really good, I love to model and make characters with it , but to use some textures Cinema 4D is really cool, you can download Gorilla grayscale textures and make  things look really cool so fast. Also Maya is really good to animate, but Cinema 4D also is good.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I recommend you is to buy a license of Digital Tutors (http://www.digitaltutors.com) is $225 dollars 6 months and they have almost all the programs for 3D, is a really good option to learn and see different things. Also you could buy the personal license with a friend  (but it's not really legal) and share it to try it. Really  this is not Digital Tutors publicity, it totally worth it,( I got it 2 months a go and I should have it a long time a go) when I started (almost 5 years ago) I looked everything that was free, and I totally hated it, because when I find something good almost all the times was incomplete, and is totally frustrating to be watching a tutorial and have to cut it in the half because you don't have the next file. Now there are things in youtube really useful. \r\n\r\nAlso learn to use After effects is really useful to composite and to do some easy 3D stuff, look the plugin element 3D from Video Copilot, is really useful to do some fast stuff, the render is so fast (really fast). \r\n\r\nIf you have iphone (I dont know if is in android) I recommend you to download this apps : FPS calculate (to take the time of your movements )and motion timer (to make some animation curves of your movements) it is an initial kit to animate. Also read the animator`s Survival Kit it is a really good book and gonna make you understand the 12 principles of animation.\r\n\r\nIf in the future you really like animation, look to buy a Wacom, it's also really useful in animation for modelling, texturing and make some sketches.\r\n\r\nYou will need a lot of patience with the renders, 3D animation is a combination of technology, art and a lot of patience. Say good bye to your butt, you gonna be seated a lot of time :P\r\n\r\nAlso is useful learn to draw, make your first moves with some tutorials.\r\n\r\nHope it could be useful and good luck with animation :)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",

I know a lot about the design world too, like Web Design as well. Is there a course I should take that would cover both graphic and web design?

I load it successfully but when I wanted to activate the CAD it didn't give me option to type activation code and it seems I only have 30 days to use the CAD. Does anyone knows how to extend it? OR I shouldn't worry about it. I try to contact via e-mail with help desk but it seems no e-mail on their website and the form that I to fill and send it to them doesn't accept the version of CAD I was typing. Any idea what should I do????",

Using flash, Iphone can not, galaxy can. Iphone settings are not customizeable past what they allow you to do, samsung galaxies are! \r\n\r\nyou can do much more on just what you get from the factory by samsung than you can with apple. Apple keeps you fom using key features like document editors which come standard with Galaxy phones. You can also do more edtiting in Samsung phones becuase samsung allows you to do whatever you want because it is YOUR product. If you mess with the software on a galaxy ...no big deal...its yours. If you mess with the software on an iphone you will be stopped from using all apple services. \r\n\r\nSee apple wants their phones the same as the way they sent them to you. \r\nI will word it differently...I am making the iphone seem like a bad phone. It isnt. See the iphone is a great phone if you want the best apps. Galaxy is the best phone if you care about design and functionality. Apple constantly releases new apps while Galaxy stands by making sure you have the best capability on your phone. Yes @inkyvoyd It has more ram, Here is what gets me though. SD CARE CAPABILITY! Samsung Galaxy phones can do all the iphone can and more. you can have the hardrive already on your phone PLUS extra space on a sd card. while apple limits you to 8gb and up to 16 gb...\r\n\r\nIN ALL REALITY IF YOU BUY AN 8 GB IPHONE YOU REALLY GET A 6.48 GB IPHONE! they sell them under false size's! if you get a 16 gb Galaxy you get...you guessed it a 16 gb galaxy...and if you want you can put a 32 gb sd card in it and raise it to 48 gb! and they sell the phones alone with more than 32 gb! So all of that being said which is better?\r\n\r\nBottom line...If you want the best apps..get an iphone but the apps get boring quick. If you want the best quality and functionality/capabilitie get a galaxy!\r\nPS:\r\nThe galaxy four will have an eye reader...what i mean by that is you can scroll and click with your eyes! and also the best touch screen/display and the best camera, voice recignition to date!

But owning a galaxy note 1, i know you really get used to it and start liking it. The bigger, the better, with a good resolution of course. I feel samsung kinda messed it up with galaxy grand. The resolution just isnt good enough. \r\n\r\nAlso i feel iphone is really overpriced. Samsung sells most phones today, but apple still makes more profit. That says it all.\r\n\r\nWith the new iphone 5, they changed the dock. That means anyone who uses had an iphone, wont be able to use any accessories they had. Thats mean of apple. \r\n\r\nWell talk about features, look at S4. Samsung is really pushing the limits. Lets see what the come up with in S5. :P I dont think apple can even come close to samsung here anytime soon.\r\n\r\nIn terms of design, the plastic stuff spoils it for the galaxy series. Most of the galaxy phones, if not all have it. Iphone wins it for me here. And htc one, with an all metal body is worth a mention here. \r\n\r\nBut overall, with the pricing, the apps and everything, as @SnuggieLad said, galaxy is YOUR phone. My vote goes to galaxy.",

The spreadsheet is on google drive,so we can chat together and choose who mworks on which project, and we use this thread to post each others work and provide feedback on it. Then, when its good enough we mark the request on th spreadsheet finished and we email the requester with the result.\r\n\r\nHow ari and snuggle and I got together?\r\n\r\nWell, ari is amazing at this type of stuff, so we worked out something together.\r\nSnuggle then later became part of the team, but he was designingn owls previously.\r\n\r\nGlady like our project!",

I have photoshop, but they use gimp because they do not need all of the human editing features i do. We work as a team to design owls that we make though. Ari Really goes above and beyond...you give her an idea she takes it and runs with it. So that is the design process. Now for the leader. Sean! He Programs better than anyone i know! He is the one that put all this together. I worked with SWAG before but now i work with @dumbsearch2 Aka. Sean. He is the glue that holds us together and is the one that keeps us motivated!",

They design everything from cereal boxes to stereos, though most specialize in a particular area, such as automobiles. \r\n\r\nInterior Designer \r\nInterior designers focus on researching, planning, developing, and implementing designs for indoor environments, such as living rooms or office lobbies. \r\n\r\nFashion Designer Fashion designers determine the look of the shoes, dresses, shirts, and pants you wear. \r\n\r\nOther Careers If you're in the performing arts, you've probably worked with costume designers and set designers. A furniture designers created the last couch you sat on. And the merchandise display at your local department store is the work of a designer. Designers have a variety of career options open to them, because we're surrounded by designs, from landscapes to textiles. In fact, designers can find ways to apply the principles of design, such as form, color, and function, to anything we create. The most limiting factor to design is imagination: If you can imagine it, you can probably find a way to design it.\r\n\r\nFor further more information go to: https://www.wetfeet.com/articles/career-overview-design\r\n",
